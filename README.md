Goal: Implement the O(nW) matrix based dynamic programming 
algorithm to solve the Knapsack problem.
     
THIS PROGRAM MUST BE RAN IN PYTHON 3.7!
--
Open terminal (or command line if you're running Windows) head to the
directory for the unzipped program (Where you unzipped the turn-in file)
You should see main.py and some other python source files.
To run the program simply type:
python main.py

- This assumes you have python installed correctly!

This program just runs, it assumes your desired data is in file called "knapsack.txt"
If you wish to run different data, you must replace "knapsack.txt" with a file containing
the data you wish to execute, in the proper format, and in the input folder.

No requirements for a user interface were listed, so none was made.

- All output goes to console, as per requirements.
